Syntax of Variable:

1. dataType variableName = variableValue;

2. dataType variableName;
   variableName = variableValue;

Two types of data Types:
--Primitive data Types
  a) We know in advance how much space they will occupy
  b) We don't need objects in order to use them

--Non-primitive data types
    a) We don't know in advance how much space they will occupy
    b) We need objects in order to use them
