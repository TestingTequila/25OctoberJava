Variables: Variables are like boxes/jars/containers that are made to store/hold something
Syntax of Variable:

1. dataType variableName = variableValue;

2. dataType variableName;
   variableName = variableValue;
===========================================================================================
Two types of data Types:
--Primitive data Types
  a) We know in advance how much space they will occupy
  b) We don't need objects in order to use them
  Integer Family--byte[1], short[2], int[4], long[8], Floating point family-->float[4], double[8]
                  char[], boolean[]

--Non-primitive data types
    a) We don't know in advance how much space they will occupy
    b) We need objects in order to use them
===============================================================================
1. byte and short should not be used for mathematical operations and will also not be allowed by JVM
2. char will start behaving like a number if you perform mathematical operations over it
==========================================STATEMENTS=============================
Whenever we have to make decisions, we use statements
//If Statement
        if(condition)
        {
          this will execute only if condition is true
        }
In Multiple if statement, all the conditions will be verified even if any condition is true


//If-else Statement
        if(condition)
        {
          this will execute only if condition is true
        }
        else
        {
           this will execute only if condition is false
        }

// In multiple ifs with else, else part will always execute if the last condition before else part is false
// In multiple else if statement, once the condition is true, it will not bother to check other conditions
// Use switch for exact value match. Will not work for range >, <, =>, =< etc. For such, if else or is-else if is preferred
   switch can be used on Strings and all integer members except long [String, char, byte, short, int]

==============Loops=================================
-Repetitive Tasks
  -while loop
   int i=value;
   while(condition)
   {
      this will execute only if condition is true;
      I/D;
   }

  -for loop
     for(int i=value;condition;I/D)
     {
        this will execute only if condition is true;
     }

  -advanced for loop
